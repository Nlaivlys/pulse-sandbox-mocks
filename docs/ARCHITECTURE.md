## Profile system

Fixture data is loaded from a profile module selected by `PULSE_SANDBOX_PROFILE` (default `baseline`). Profiles live under `pulse_sandbox/profiles/{name}.py`. Each profile exports the full namespaced data set (`HUBSPOT_*`, `PRODUCTIVE_*`); the service-local `fixtures.py` modules are thin re-export shims.

### Why this design

- **One env var, one config touch-point.** Switching scenarios doesn't require coordinating multiple env vars or fixture-file edits.
- **Profile = scenario.** Each profile module is one place to reason about a complete dataset.
- **Additive composition.** Non-baseline profiles import baseline and append, so baseline behavior never breaks accidentally.

### Available profiles

| Profile | What it adds |
|---|---|
| `baseline` | Default happy-path data (8 HC deals, 7 people, 5 projects, etc.) |
| `rich` | Baseline + 5 scenario-tuned HubSpot deals + 1 company + 1 Productive scenario, each pinned to a specific Pulse warning |

See [FIXTURES.md](./FIXTURES.md) for the full per-deal scenario inventory.

### Loader behavior

`pulse_sandbox/profiles/__init__.py` exposes `load_active_profile()`:

```python
from pulse_sandbox.profiles import load_active_profile
profile = load_active_profile()  # reads PULSE_SANDBOX_PROFILE env var
deals = profile.HUBSPOT_DEALS
```

Empty string or unset → `baseline`. Unknown profile name → `ModuleNotFoundError` with a helpful message listing available profiles.

The env var is read at module load time, so changing the profile requires a server restart (consistent with how `PULSE_API_MODE` works).

### Pulse-side drift shim (cross-repo coupling note)

One Pulse-side concept needs a shim that lives in the Pulse repo, not here: **deal close-date drift history**. That data lives in Pulse's Supabase `deal_closedate_history` table — not an external API the sandbox can mock.

Pulse handles it the same way as the OpenAI/Resend/Slack SDK shims: a service module (`backend/api/services/_drift_history.py`) checks `is_sandbox_mode()` and returns hardcoded fake drift entries for sandbox-tagged HubSpot deal IDs. Production code path is unchanged when sandbox mode is off.

The fake-drift dict is sized to the sandbox profiles' deal IDs (9001, 9003, 9007 from baseline; 9101 from rich). Adding new sandbox scenario deals with drift means editing both the rich profile here AND the `_SANDBOX_DRIFT` dict in Pulse.

---

## Toggle contract (single switch)

Pulse's sandbox mode is opt-in via a single env var:

```
PULSE_API_MODE=sandbox  # → all external services route to localhost:9000 mocks
PULSE_API_MODE=live     # → real external APIs (default, production-safe)
```

The HubSpot and Productive base URLs auto-derive in Pulse's `config.py` and `services/hubspot.py` via a small `_resolve_api_base()` helper:

```python
def _resolve_api_base(env_var, real_url, sandbox_path):
    explicit = os.getenv(env_var)
    if explicit: return explicit                         # manual override wins
    if PULSE_API_MODE == "sandbox":
        return f"{SANDBOX_BASE_URL}{sandbox_path}"        # auto-derived
    return real_url                                       # real prod URL
```

The OpenAI / Resend / Slack SDK shims switch via Pulse's `_sandbox_factory.py` keyed off the same `PULSE_API_MODE` (with optional per-service overrides for mix-and-match testing).

Pulse exposes a `GET /api/runtime/info` endpoint (no auth required) that returns the active mode + resolved base URLs, used by the frontend to render a small `● SANDBOX` badge in the nav when local mocks are active.

---

## Why this exists

Pulse depends on six external services (HubSpot, Productive, OpenAI, Resend, Slack, Clerk). Local development against live APIs has three problems:

1. **Cost** — every dashboard render burns API quota.
2. **Pollution** — local development creates real HubSpot deals, real Slack channels, real Productive bookings.
3. **Coupling** — when an external service rotates a token or changes a response shape, every developer's local environment breaks until the token/contract is updated.

The sandbox decouples Pulse from live APIs for local dev. It also doubles as a **portability proof** — if Pulse can run against a swappable mock layer, it can run against any client's data source via the same abstraction. That's a Pulse productization milestone.

## Two mocking strategies, one package

The sandbox uses a **hybrid approach** because the services Pulse calls split cleanly into two categories:

| Category | Services | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **HTTP REST clients** (Pulse hand-rolls the requests) | HubSpot, Productive | HTTP-level mock server — Pulse points its env-var-driven base URL at `localhost:9000`, the FastAPI mock answers |
| **Vendor SDK clients** (Pulse uses the vendor's Python SDK) | OpenAI, Resend, Slack | SDK-level shim — a Python class/module mimicking the vendor SDK's surface; Pulse's factory swaps in the shim when sandbox mode is active |

**Why split?** HTTP-mocking the OpenAI/Resend/Slack SDKs would require simulating the SDKs' HTTP layer (auth headers, retries, response object construction). At the SDK boundary, mocking is ~10 lines per method. The HTTP-mock approach makes sense when Pulse is doing the HTTP work itself — which it is for HubSpot and Productive.

## Critical design decisions

### 1. SDK shims have zero heavy dependencies

The SDK shims are pure-stdlib (just `dataclasses`, `logging`, `threading`, `uuid`, `time`). They do NOT depend on FastAPI or pydantic 2.x.

**Why this matters:** Pulse depends on `clerk-sdk-python` 0.1.0, which pins pydantic to 1.x. If the sandbox package required pydantic 2.x (via FastAPI), installing it in Pulse's venv would break Clerk auth.

So the package is split:
- **Default install** (`pip install pulse-sandbox-mocks`) — shims only, safe for Pulse's venv
- **Server extras** (`pip install pulse-sandbox-mocks[server]`) — adds FastAPI for the HTTP mock server, must be installed in a separate venv

### 2. Slack shim's `SlackApiError` inherits from the real one

The shim's `SlackApiError` class tries to inherit from `slack_sdk.errors.SlackApiError` (using a try/except so it falls back to plain `Exception` when slack_sdk isn't installed in the sandbox repo's standalone venv).

**Why:** Pulse's call sites do `except SlackApiError as e:` against the **real** slack_sdk class. If the shim's exception didn't inherit from the real one, a shim-raised exception would NOT be caught, and the talent-pipeline flow would crash instead of degrading gracefully.

This was discovered during Pulse-side regression testing and is the most subtle correctness requirement in the codebase.

### 3. Sample data uses Servant production custom-field IDs

Productive's `/people` and `/custom_fields` endpoints reference custom fields by numeric IDs (55149, 55151, 55153, 55147). Pulse's parser hard-codes these IDs to extract Employee Type, Deployable Team, % Allocation, and Discipline.

The sandbox fixtures use the same IDs. Otherwise Pulse would render every person as "unclassified."

If a future client deployment uses different custom field IDs, the sandbox fixtures would need to be parameterized. That's a Phase 2 item (currently out of scope).

### 4. Pagination via explicit-null `links.next`

Productive's JSON:API responses include `links.next` for pagination. Pulse's `paginate_get()` walks the chain by reading `body.get("links", {}).get("next")`.

The sandbox sets `links.next` to **explicit `None`** rather than omitting the field. Pulse's pagination terminates correctly only when the value is falsy — omitting the field would also work, but explicit `None` matches the real Productive API's behavior more closely.

### 5. In-memory state for stateful endpoints

The Slack shim's `WebClient` keeps a per-instance `_channels` dict so `conversations_create` followed by `conversations_invite` round-trips correctly within the same process. State resets on process restart.

For Phase 2, this could move to SQLite for cross-restart durability. Today that complexity isn't worth it — Pulse doesn't need durable state for a local-dev sandbox.

### 6. Health-check route at `app.py:160`

Pulse's health-check endpoint hits HubSpot directly with a hardcoded URL: `requests.get("https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/deals", limit=1)`. The original code bypassed the `hubspot.py` shared client.

The sandbox refactor introduces `HUBSPOT_API_BASE` as the single source of truth for the HubSpot base URL. The health-check now uses this constant, so sandbox mode covers it without a separate code path.

The sandbox includes a `GET /hubspot/crm/v3/objects/deals` endpoint specifically to satisfy this health-check.

## How to extend

### Add a new HubSpot endpoint

1. Add a route handler in `pulse_sandbox/hubspot/routes.py` matching the path Pulse calls
2. If new sample data is needed, extend `pulse_sandbox/hubspot/fixtures.py`
3. Add tests in `tests/test_hubspot_routes.py` for the happy path and at least one edge case

### Add a new Productive endpoint

Same pattern as HubSpot, but use the `pulse_sandbox.productive.jsonapi` helpers (`make_resource`, `to_one_rel`, `to_many_rel`, `envelope`) to keep response shapes consistent. Don't hand-roll JSON:API objects.

### Add a new SDK shim

1. Create `pulse_sandbox/shims/<service>.py` mirroring the vendor SDK's surface for the methods Pulse actually calls
2. Add a factory function in Pulse's `backend/api/services/_sandbox_factory.py` that returns the shim or the real SDK based on the env var
3. Refactor Pulse's call sites to go through the factory
4. Add tests in `tests/test_shims.py` (sandbox repo) and `tests/test_sandbox_factory.py` (Pulse repo)

### Update fixture data

Edit the `fixtures.py` files directly. There's no JSON loading layer in Phase 1 — sample data is Python dicts, version-controlled with the code.

For larger or anonymized-real datasets, Phase 2 will add a JSON loader keyed on env var (e.g., `PULSE_SANDBOX_FIXTURES_DIR`).

## Performance characteristics

The full test suite (59 tests) runs in **~80ms**. Mock endpoints respond in **<1ms**. The sandbox is fast enough that running it during local dev adds zero perceptible latency vs. live API calls (which are typically 100-500ms).

## What this is NOT

- **Not a security boundary.** The sandbox accepts any token. Don't run it on a public network.
- **Not an integration test.** It tests Pulse's *response-parsing* layer; it does NOT test the *contract* with the real APIs. If HubSpot changes a response shape, Pulse will pass against the sandbox but fail against production. Real-API integration tests are a separate concern (out of scope).
- **Not a load-test fixture.** All state is in-memory; running thousands of concurrent requests will saturate a single Python process.
